							<h2>Number Guessing Game</h2>

							<p>This number guessing game was an exercise in setting up web hosting, html, css, and php. This was my first usage of real php for a working project. I also learned the basics of bootstrap to design the front end. A database keeps track of the users accounts and displays a top ten scores once a game is completed.</p>

							<p><a href="https://github.com/tagehigley/CS3750Group/tree/main/Hangman"><strong>Git Hub Code!</strong></a></p>
							<p>This game man game was a group collaboration between myself and three group members. We built off our own previous number guessing games to design and build hangman. The game is written in c# using blazor and WebAssembly. Hangman uses an access database to store user profiles. The game checks the server asynchronously to determine if a letter is correct. Once the word has been correctly guessed the top ten scores are displayed.</p>

							<h2>Speed!</h2>

							<p><a href="https://github.com/tagehigley/CS3750Group/tree/main/Speed"><strong>Git Hub Code!</strong></a></p>
							<p>Speed is a classic two player card game. This project was also a group collaboration between myself and my three group members. The game was built using c# and blazor. Since speed is a quick paced game without turns we decided to utilize SignalR to update each users screens after passing data to the server regarding a players move. The game is won when one of the two players rids themselves of all of their cards. </p>

							<h2>Scholarship Application</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The scholarship application site of Weber State was in need of some updating. My professor decided to task the groups of students to the challenge of updating the app to dotnet 6.0 and find some of the major bugs that were hidden within the site. The site was created in Asp.net and was originally written in dotnet 2.0. My group and I worked as a team to target any issues we could find and provide clear and bug free solutions to the outstanding bugs. My overall contribution to the group was updating from dotnet 2.0 to dotnet 6.0.</p>
							<p>Updating a "legacy" project to the latest dotnet framework was a large task. There is only so much help online when it comes to updating someone elses code. After three days of effort the project was building on dotnet 6.0 and my group was able to continue debugging and finished the project.</p>
